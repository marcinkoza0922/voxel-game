# AGENTS.md
- Language: Rust.
- Specs: `PROPOSAL.md` (what), `docs/DESIGN.md` (how; keep updated).
- Tests: `cargo nextest run` (quiet profile in `.config/nextest.toml`). Never
  run verbose test output unless debugging a specific failure.
- Lint/build: `cargo clippy --message-format=short`; `.cargo/config.toml` is
  set to quiet. Truncate long output.
- If requirements are unclear, ask before assuming.
- You may create any helper tools/functionality needed to build, test, or
  debug. Put them in `tools/` and document them in DESIGN.md.
